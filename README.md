# Canvas Render Engine VS - REVS

**THIS IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

REVS is a simple render engine for HTML in TypeScript.

It has a layer system, some basic objects, a hierarchy, callback functionality, and lots more.
Also, there is more to come!

I wrote REVS for another project of mine, that's where the 'VS' comes from - it stands for visual scripting.

**But of course you can use it for everything, it is not connected in any way but the name to VSJS!**

### Usage

To build, just run `npm run build-local`.
This will build a bundled JavaScript file in the `public` directory.
(The package build is not ready yet)

You can find an example and some basic info on how to use it in `public/index.html`.
